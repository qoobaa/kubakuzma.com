- content: Kuba is one of the top developers I know. He tries to understand the business use cases behind features to make better design decisions. I have grown to trust him so much, I have offloaded entire projects to him. He enjoys learning and using new tools to apply them to challenging problems. I hope to work with Kuba for a long time to come.
